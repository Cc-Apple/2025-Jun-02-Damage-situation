On June 2, 2025, iPad logs showed facts: MDM profile operations, abnormal SiriSearchFeedback bursts, and bug_type 225/226 clusters linked to MyViettel-App. In the consolidated ZIP, these traces vanished, raising the hypothesis of tampering/obfuscation. This day marks a pivot toward Kabuki deployment.
On June 2, 2025, iPad logs revealed the following facts: traces of MDM configuration profile operations, repeated SiriSearchFeedback bursts, CloudKit/nsurlsessiond activity inside Analytics, and clusters of bug_type 225 and 226 indicating resource pressure and forced termination. These appeared in parallel with MyViettel-App communication, showing involvement beyond normal user-level apps. In contrast, the consolidated ZIP analysis for the same date showed that these traces were missing, leading to the hypothesis that tampering or obfuscation mechanisms had been applied. Thus, Phase 1 exposed the concrete deployment of Kabuki, while Phase 2 demonstrated the strengthening of log-hiding measures. Taken together, the progression from Pegasus to Kabuki can be characterized as a dual process: “injection” followed by “concealment.” This combined analysis now serves as a reliable foundation for international reporting, research, and evidentiary use.
